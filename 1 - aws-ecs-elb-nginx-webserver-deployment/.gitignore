# .gitignore for Terraform projects

# Local Terraform state files
# These files contain the state of your managed infrastructure.
# They can contain sensitive data and should not be committed, especially in a team environment.
# Use remote state (like an S3 bucket or Terraform Cloud) instead.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*.backup

# Crash log
# Automatically generated if Terraform crashes.
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files to avoid committing sensitive data
# It is a best practice to use a terraform.tfvars.example file
# (which is committed to git) to show which variables are needed.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Local plan files
# These can also contain sensitive data and are for temporary use.
*.tfplan

# The .terraform directory contains provider plugins and modules.
# This directory is created by 'terraform init' and can be large.
# It should always be regenerated by each user.
.terraform/

# Override files
# These are meant for local overrides of your configuration and should not be
# shared with the team.
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# CLI configuration files
# These are user-specific and should not be versioned.
